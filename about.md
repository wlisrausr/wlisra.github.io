  <h4>Why am I mixing two languages on this blog?</h4>
  <p>Honestly, I want to use English completely on this blog, but I'm not quite confident yet with my english skill. I have to practice more to have a better sense of writing at this language. So, instead of only using Bahasa as blog primary language, I will mix it with English too.</p>
