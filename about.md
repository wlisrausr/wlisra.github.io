  <h4>Where do I live?</h4>
  <p>Currently in Bandung area, West Java, Indonesia.</p>

  <p>Anything that would be useful for myself, company and people.</p>

  <h4>What kind of articles that I wrote on this blog?</h4>
  <p>Anything that related to my programming life & experiences.</p>

  <h4>Why am I mixing two languages on this blog?</h4>
  <p>Honestly, I want to use English completely on this blog, but I'm not quite confident yet with my english skill. I have to practice more to have a better sense of writing at this language. So, instead of only using Bahasa as blog primary language, I will mix it with English too.</p>
