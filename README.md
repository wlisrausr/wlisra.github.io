### Wanda Ichsanul Isra's GitHub Pages

This repo is currently my main repo to hold all of my geek notes/posts. Build using Jekyll and beautiful theme from [Brian Maier Jr.](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul). So, there is nothing to see in here unless you're interested to read the notes/posts directly in markdown version.

> Note: If you're not yet familiar with GitHub pages, you can follow its basic tutorial from here https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/.
